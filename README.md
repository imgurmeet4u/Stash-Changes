# Stash-Changes

Git stash-<br>
• Git stash is a built-in command with the distributed Version control tool in Git that locally stores all the most recent changes in a workspace and resets the state of the workspace to the prior commit state.<br>
• A user can retrieve all files put into the stash with the git stash pop and git stash apply commands.<br>

Sometimes you want to switch the branches, but you are working on an incomplete part of your current project. You don't want to make a commit of half-done work. Git stashing allows you to do so. The git stash command enables you to switch branches without committing the current branch.<br>
